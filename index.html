            <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
            <p>you fuck I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing,
                and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-<strong>bitch</strong>. "Good design is as little design as possible."

            <h2 class="premiertitre">Seriously , what the fuck else ?</h2>
           
            <p> You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB
                <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/" title="website">motherfuckingwebsite(.com) </a>is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website
                run even on a toast
            </p>

                    <h2 class="deuxiemetitre">Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
                    <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes
                        to your fucking site, and some <span>motherfucker</span>jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty
                        shit. You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.

            <a href="images/roues.jpg"><img src="images/roues2.jpeg" class="imageflottante" alt="imageflottante" title="agrandir" /></a> entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you
            could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi. " at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>

            <p> Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking
                message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>
